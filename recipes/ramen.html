    <!--Short description-->
    <p>Simmering some garlic, ginger, and dried mushrooms with your 
        chicken broth makes for a great quickie “stock”. 
        A good while in the pot will get some nice flavors going that 
        will soon be soaked up by those noodles. And by good while, 
        I mean 19 minutes, because the whole thing takes 20. 
        The soft egg on tops will get you all the Instagram likes, and 
        the panko and extra chili oil or Sriracha will light your mouth up with joy.
        </p>
    <p>At the end of the day, a deep bowl of bright veggies + 
        flavorful broth + golden panko crumbs + soft-boiled egg + chewy, 
        tangled noodles is not going to let you down.</p>
